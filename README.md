# List Of Projects During 30 Day Project Challange
-This is a small challange I decided to take on with the purpose of improving my back-end development skills. After exploring fullstack development, I have realized 
 that most of my interest in develpment deals with the backend. 
-This challange will require me to either create or expand on a previous project using some combination of MongoDB, PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, GraphQL for the back-end. 
 For the front-end I will use React and Bootstrap/CSS to improve my flex-box skills. 
-Each project's deployed site or github repo must be added to this site.
-As I progress, I aim to take on more challenging projects.
